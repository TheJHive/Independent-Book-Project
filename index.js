A note to my future self:
Dear Future Self,
You left this js file in your Assignment Files
folder for the sake of keeping it.
It was not meant to be run. You will need
to install chalk.
Don't run this, you didn't put this here
to let it be run again.
Close VSCode now, I know you have it open.
Thanks,
Past You.
